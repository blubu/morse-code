# Steps to Recreate Morse Code Converter
This README provides a step-by-step guide to help you recreate the Morse Code Converter project from scratch on your local machine.
## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:
- Python (version 3.6 or higher)
- Any GUI library compatible with Python
- Git (optional, for cloning the repository)
Choose a GUI library that suits your preferences and requirements. Some popular options include:
- PyQt5
- Tkinter
- wxPython
- Kivy
- PySide2
Install the chosen GUI library using the library-specific installation instructions.
## Steps
**1. Create a Window:**
- Import the necessary libraries.
- Set up a graphical user interface (GUI) window.
- Define the dimensions, title, and other properties of the window.
**2. Add Input Textboxes:**
- Create input textboxes.
- Position and style the textboxes within the GUI window.
**3. Create a Convert Button:**
- Implement a "Convert" button.
- Define a function that will be executed when the button is clicked.
- Initially, the function can print the text from the input textbox.
**4. Convert Text to Morse:**
- Define a function to convert the text input into morse code.
- Implement the logic to convert each character to its respective morse code representation.
- Store the converted morse code as a string.
**5. Print Converted Output to the GUI Window:**
- Create an output area within the GUI window to display the converted Morse code.
- Update the output area with the converted Morse code when the "Convert" button is clicked.
**6. Convert Morse to Text:**
- Define a function to convert morse code back to text.
- Implement the logic to parse the morse code and convert it back to text.
- Store the converted text as a string.
**7. Create an Option Tab:**
- Introduce an option tab within the GUI window to select between "Text to Morse" and "Morse to Text" conversions.
- Set up the necessary controls, such as radio buttons or dropdown menus, to enable the selection.
**8. Connect Convert Button to the Required Function:**
- Modify the "Convert" button function to call the appropriate conversion function based on the selected option.
- If the "Text to Morse" option is selected, call the function that converts text to morse.
- If the "Morse to Text" option is selected, call the function that converts morse code to text.
**9. Add Copy Button to Clipboard:**
- Implement a "Copy" button within the GUI window.
- Define a function that copies the converted output to the clipboard when the button is clicked.
**10. Customize GUI Elements:**
- Set an icon for the application window.
- Adjust the background color, element colors, and layouts to improve the visual appearance.
**11. Documentation:**
- Ensure proper documentation and comments throughout the code to enhance readability and maintainability.
- Organize the code by splitting it into smaller, easy-to-understand chunks, such as functions or classes.
